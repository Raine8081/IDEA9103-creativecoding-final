-Random seed/Berlin noise
-The random square is always moving
-The Square wall behind the rect would move through your mouse move, and make the painting full of live
-If you press the mouse, all the animation would stop

-P.S:I add the mousePress function to make all the animation stop, but this notifiction was out of maximum 200 words in design documents so I add the part in readme.
